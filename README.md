If you want to know more about this running game, please refer to my blog [Making an Interactive Running Game with Head or Body Movement Using TensorFlow.js](https://chengkang520.github.io/article/tfjs_runing_rabbit/).

In the future, I will upload how to use 3D pose models for developing human interactive games. For an instance, Fighting Games with Body Gestures.
